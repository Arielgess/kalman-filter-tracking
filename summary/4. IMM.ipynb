    "# Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm is used when the system dynamics can switch between different motion models. For example, a UAV alternating between constant velocity (CV), coordinated turn (CT), or constant acceleration (CA).  \n",
    "Instead of assuming a single fixed model, the IMM maintains multiple Kalman Filters, and blends their results according to the probability that each model is active at the current time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the IMM is a probabilistic mechanism that merges several KFs (or EKFs) into one overall estimate.\n"

    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard Kalman Filter assumes a single dynamic model.  \n",
    "However, real-world targets often change behaviors, and do not follow a single motion model.  \n",
    "Thus, Running just one KF would just not fit the desired trajectory of such a target.\n",
    "The IMM algorithm runs $k$ KFs in parallel, and accounts for the possibility of the target changing from one motion model to another (the motion models must be described by some KF in the IMM algorithm). It uses bayesian inference to assign probabilities to each model, and then continues to calculate the total estimate.\n",
    "A very good overview of the method is in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04875.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step $k$, the IMM goes through four phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialization — prepare each model’s initial state based on previous probabilities. This happens at every time step.  \n",
    "2. State Estimation — run $k$ parallel KFs (predict + update).  \n",
    "3. Model Probability Update — use measurement likelihoods to update which model is more likely now (using Bayes' Theorem).\n",
    "4. Total Estimation — merge all model outputs into one final state estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will not write here the full euqations, but they are written and explained in the paper I cited above, this is not a hard read and very recommended.\n"
