    "# Basic State Space Models (SSMs)\n",
    "This notebook gives a short overview of the concept of state space models (SSMs).  \n",
    "It is meant as a concise summary and reference, and provide some basic understanding for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "An SSM is a mathematical model, (generally of a physical system but that's not always the case), that uses keeps state variables, and evolve over time based on inputs from the environment.\n",
    "While the SSM model keeps the state as its internal variable, it can also output values at any given times. The output will be based (mostly, if not solely) on the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example for an SSM is the Kalman Filter, which will be elaborated in the next notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall focus on the discrete case of an SSMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**State update (dynamics):**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_{k+1} = A x_k + B u_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output (observation):**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{k+1} = C x_{k+1} + D u_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(x_k\\): hidden state at time step \\(k\\)  \n",
    "- \\(u_k\\): input\n",
    "- \\(y_k\\): output\n",
    "- \\(A\\): state transition matrix  \n",
    "- \\(B\\): input matrix\n",
    "- \\(C\\): observation/output matrix  \n",
    "- \\(D\\): feedthrough matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Kalman Filter, \\(A, B, C, D\\) are chosen from physics/kinematics. We shall discuss it further in the next notebook\n",
    "- In Neural Network that work with SSMs, such as Mamba, the same structure is used but the parameters \\(A,B,C,D\\) are learned from data instead of derived from physics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the same equations describe both classical control/tracking and neural SSMs — the difference is whether the system matrices are fixed from a physical or some other model, or learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usages\n",
    "SSMs are typically used to represent dynamical systems in engineering - for example, an SSM could describe the trajectory of an airplane taking off, given the appropriate physics and environment matrices (for example, the measurement's noise).\n",
    "Typical tasks for SSMs (and those that will interest us) are:\n",
    "- Filtering: estimating the current hidden state from past data\n",
    "- Smoothing: estimating past states using all available data\n",
    "- Prediction: estimating future states\n",
