    "## How Does It Work?\n",
    "Same as the linear KF, the EKF has two methods: predict and update.\n",

    "**Predict step**\n",
    "1. $\\hat{x}_{k|k-1} = f(\\hat{x}_{k-1|k-1})$\n",
    "2. $P_{k|k-1} = F_k P_{k-1|k-1}F_k^\\top + Q_{k-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Update step**\n",
    "1. The innovation: $e_k = y_k - h(\\hat{x}_{k|k-1})$\n",
    "2. The Innovation (residual) covariance: $S_{k} = H_{k} P_{k|k-1} H_{k}^\\top + R_{k}$\n",
    "3. The near-optimal Kalman gain: $K_k = P_{k|k-1}H_k^TS_k^{-1}$\n",
    "4. Updated state estimate: $\\hat{x}_{k|k} = \\hat{x}_{k|k-1} + K_ke_k$\n",
    "5. Update state covariance estimate: $P_{k|k} = (I - K_k H_k)P_{k|k-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "It operates like the KF, in the sense that we use the predict step before observing the next measurement, and then do update when we have that measuremet. As k increases, we would see that the KF can track the underlying signal better and better.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to see where we actually use the linearization. Of course, we do not use it to calculate the next states - because we know what the non-linear function is, so we can use it.\n",
    "But when we would need the linearization is to calculate the state covariance. We won't go into the maths on this, but the linearization allows us to approximate $P_{k|k-1}$ and $P_{k|k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When should we use it?\n",
    "- The system dynamics or measurements are nonlinear, but approximately linear in a small region.  \n",
    "- The first-order approximation is valid. If the nonlinearity is strong or uncertainty large, EKF may diverge.\n"
